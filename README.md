Hello and welcome to this README.

The goal of this project was to recreate an Arkanoid game using canvas.

Every frame, the canvas redraws the entire game and adjusts the elements according to their positions.

The game utilizes a simple restart function where the page is refreshed, making the code easier to maintain and less performance-heavy.

The main issue in this code is with the left and right borders of the bricks. Occasionally, when the ball hits either side of the brick, the ball goes 'inside' the brick. 
I am currently working on fixing this issue.

That's it for this README. Thanks, and have a good day.
